# Avionics
This repository brings you to the place where we are going to learn about avionics and electronics related to avionics as much as we can.
It is always better to learn while we do a real time project. So, we will divide the learning into projects.
<h1>PROJECT ONE : BUILDING A DRONE</h1>
<h1>PROJECT TWO : BUILDING A FLIGHT CONTROLLER</h1>
